# Demo — Möbius LED Heart

The first real driver of voxeled's Phase-0 spine, mapping and driving a concrete piece: the
[Möbius LED Heart](https://github.com/dnewcome/mobius-led-heart) — a steel heart-ribbon carrying
flexible LED panels, optionally given a half-twist so a single run of panels lights *both*
apparent sides.

It exercises the whole spine end-to-end:

```
heart_path parametrization → map.mjs → rig of N instances in shared world space
     (each pixel: world position + normal + fixture coords s,v + instance id)
           → hub runs a crossfading show → normalized RGB frames
                 → WebGL viewer + crossfader (WebSocket)  ← preview & control
                 → Art-Net + DDP senders (UDP)            ← real fixtures
```

## Run it

```bash
node examples/mobius-heart/run.mjs      # or: npm run demo   (Node ≥18, no dependencies)
# open http://localhost:8080
```

By default it loads [`layouts/two-hearts.yaml`](../examples/mobius-heart/layouts/two-hearts.yaml)
— a **rig of two hearts, 10 ft apart** — and runs its **auto-crossfading show**. In the viewer:

- **drag** orbit · **scroll** zoom
- **S** — the **simulator**: what the piece actually *looks like* (see below); **B** toggles its bloom
- **M** — cycle the **model** (the heart's steel rails + rods from its CAD): *translucent* →
  **opaque** (orbit and see exactly what the armature blocks from any vantage) → *hidden*. In the
  simulator the body is always an opaque occluder. See *Structures* in [`FORMAT.md`](FORMAT.md#structures--the-sculpture-itself-around-the-leds)
- **E** — the **builder** (see below): author the installation right here
- **N** — toggle the normal quills
- the **crossfader** (bottom-left) — dissolve between the first two scenes by hand; **[** / **]**
  nudge it, **A** returns to auto
- URL params: `?sim=1` boots into the simulator; `?az=<deg>&el=<deg>` sets a reproducible vantage
  (az 0 = in front, 90 = from +X); `?normals=1` shows the quills

## Builder mode (E) — author the installation

Show control plays a finished scene; the **builder** authors it — and it edits **the same layout
file** the hub loaded, so what you build is a plain, git-diffable YAML, not a separate project
format. Press **E**:

- **click** an instance to select it (a pink box marks it); a **gizmo** moves it (**T**) or rotates
  it (**R**) with 10 mm / 5° snapping, or type numbers into the position / rotation fields.
  Every change is **applied live** — the hub rebuilds the scene, patterns keep running on the
  moved fixture — and the panel says *unsaved* until you **save**, which writes the YAML back
  (comment header preserved).
- **duplicate**, **delete**, **＋ add** an instance of any fixture the layout defines.
- **emitter** (viewing angle, body size, core, softness, gain, glow — the simulator reacts at once)
  and **output** (protocol, host, port, universe/offset, channel, byte order — the patch the hub
  drives) for the selected instance; tick *apply to every … instance* to write them to the fixture
  definition instead, so all its instances inherit.
- **new fixture from a file** — define a fixture right here and place one: a name, a type
  (`mesh` = a CAD export with the LED chips as bodies, `vxl` = a baked `.vxl.json` from the Blender
  addon / Grasshopper / `vox import`, `gltf`), the LED file, its unit scale, and optionally the
  sculpture's own CAD as a structure. Paths are relative to the layout file. This is how you drop
  another piece into an installation — e.g. Thread exported as `build/thread.vxl.json`.
- **▦ make array** turns the selected entry into a **matrix** — count x·y·z × spacing — expanded by
  the hub into named instances (`heart-2-0-1`…). Moving one element moves the whole array.
  (`grid-3x3.yaml` is now a single `array:` line.) Rings and paths are the same idea in YAML —
  see *Placement generators* in [`FORMAT.md`](FORMAT.md#placement-generators--arrays-rings).
- The file is also **watched**: edit it in your editor and the scene reloads in every open viewer.

Under the hood it's two routes on the hub — `GET /layout` (doc + expanded instances with their
`src`) and `POST /layout[?write=1]` — and a text message on the bus that tells viewers to refetch.

## Control it from a phone (QR)

When the demo starts it prints a **QR code** and the LAN address of `phone.html` — scan it with any
phone on the same Wi-Fi and you get a mobile page with the show's **scenes** (tap one and it fades
in over ~1 s), the **crossfader**, and the **auto** toggle. It's a thin client of the hub's `/control`
seam — the same one the viewer's crossfader uses — polling every 1.5 s so several phones (and
auto mode) stay in sync, and the hub keeps running the show if the phone walks away. This is the
first slice of the roadmap's *hosted & public* phase: hosted is the same seam behind a public URL.
On any layout the phone page can **join the piece** (one tap, or `phone.html?join=1`): the phone becomes a one-pixel `dot` fixture showing the pattern colour at its position, and a wand. `layouts/wand.yaml` also turns the phone page into a **wand** for a fixed tracker: drag yourself on the floor plan, enable motion, point the phone — the wand instance moves in the 3D view and the lantern/torch/paint scenes follow it (see `docs/GUIDE.md` §13). **V** stands at a site vantage (a 360° backdrop wrapped around the camera — `layouts/site.yaml`, `?stand=<name>&bearing=&pitch=&fov=`; see `docs/FORMAT.md` § Site context). **R** toggles the diffused-rope look (strands drawn as lit tubes — `layouts/ropes.yaml`), **O** the auto-orbit; `?ui=bar` is the public presentation face (`docs/GUIDE.md` §13.1).

`VOX_NO_QR=1` hides the code; the QR encoder is dependency-free (`src/qr.mjs`, verified by
decoding with OpenCV in the tests).

## The simulator (S)

The dots view is the **map** — every pixel drawn the same regardless of where it points. The
simulator is the **appearance**: each LED becomes an oriented, opaque emissive body facing its
normal. Its front emits `colour × lobe(view angle) × core shape`; its back is dark backing (the
shadow behind every LED); both write depth, so the bodies occlude each other — for the heart the
bodies literally form the ribbon, dark on the back. Bloom supplies the diffusion glow. The physics
knobs come from the fixture's **emitter profile** (`viewingAngleDeg`, `sizeFrac`, `coreFrac`,
`softness`, `gain`, `glow` — [`FORMAT.md`](FORMAT.md#emitter--how-the-leds-emit-simulation)); the
lobe exponent is derived from the datasheet viewing angle, so a 120° SMD LED is exactly Lambertian,
a 10° emitter a spot, a 170° one a diffused rope — one shader from laser to rope.

The first thing it revealed: from the old fixed front camera only **7 % of the heart's LEDs face
you** — the ribbon's lit faces point the other way, so the front view is mostly the dark backside,
and the twist is where a face turns toward you. The viewer now defaults to the vantage **where the
light goes** (along the mean emission direction). Orbit around and watch faces light and darken as
their lobes sweep past the camera — that is the piece as an audience will see it, not as the map
draws it.

The rig, fixture params, and scene list all live in the **layout file** (see below) — edit the
YAML, not env vars. What remains as env:

| var | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `VOX_LAYOUT` | `…/layouts/two-hearts.yaml` | which YAML layout to load |
| `VOX_PATTERN` | — | run ONE pattern instead of the show: `ribbonChase` \| `worldWipe` \| `planeSweep` \| `normalRGB` \| `spotlight` \| `projector` \| `helix` \| `lantern` \| `swirl` \| `drops` |
| `ARTNET` | — | host to stream Art-Net to (e.g. `192.168.1.50`) |
| `DDP` | — | host to stream DDP to (e.g. `192.168.1.60`) |
| `VOX_LISTEN` | — | TCP port to receive colors from an external source (e.g. TiXL's `VoxeledOutput`); merges over the internal show at priority 100 (the layout's `inputs:` block is the full form — several sources at once, see `docs/interop/protocols.md`) |
| `VOX_DDP_IN` | — | UDP port (4048) on which voxeled is a native **DDP Display** — xLights / FPP / LedFx / Chromatik / WLED-style senders drive the preview, simulator and patch (DDP in → any protocol out), merged over the show. See [`interop/protocols.md`](interop/protocols.md#voxeled-as-a-ddp-display-receiver) |

```bash
VOX_LAYOUT=examples/mobius-heart/layouts/grid-3x3.yaml node examples/mobius-heart/run.mjs      # 3×3 matrix, 9 hearts
VOX_LAYOUT=examples/mobius-heart/layouts/facing-hearts.yaml node examples/mobius-heart/run.mjs # 4 hearts, alternating 180°
node examples/mobius-heart/run.mjs examples/mobius-heart/layouts/columns.yaml        # 8 rolled-panel columns on a floor (type: tube)
VOX_PATTERN=worldWipe node examples/mobius-heart/run.mjs           # one pattern, no crossfade
ARTNET=192.168.1.50 node examples/mobius-heart/run.mjs             # + drive real Art-Net fixtures
```

Shortcuts (Makefile, same as the `npm run demo:*` scripts):

```bash
make grid        # 3×3 matrix        make demo     # default two-hearts
make facing      # 4 rotated hearts  make test     # full suite + render gate
make export      # → build/*.glb     make stop     # free port 8080
```

Export the map for other tools — `make export LAYOUT=examples/mobius-heart/layouts/grid-3x3.yaml`
writes a glTF `.glb` (opens in Blender / TouchDesigner / three.js) + the canonical `.vxl.json`.
See [`FORMAT.md`](FORMAT.md) for the scene format and glTF mapping.

Just the map (programmatic, writes a scene file):

```bash
node examples/mobius-heart/map.mjs --hearts 2 --spacing 10 --pitch 10 --twist mobius
```

## The mapping — why this piece is the ideal first target

Because the heart is **generated from a parametric ribbon**, every LED's world position *and*
emission normal are exact — no camera scan, no averaging of CAD tube normals (the thread-3d
blocker). At perimeter arclength `arc`, `heart_path` gives:

- `point(arc)` — a point on the centreline (mm),
- `tangent(arc)` = **T** — along the ribbon,
- `widthDir(arc)` = **D** = `Ẑ·cosθ + R̂·sinθ` — across the band, spiralling with the twist,
- and the lit-face **emission normal is `F = T × D`** — exactly what the sculpture's own
  simulator computes.

A pixel at across-offset `off ∈ [−band/2, +band/2]` is `p = point(arc) + D·off`, with normal `F`.
Each pixel also carries a ribbon coordinate `(s, v)` = (normalized arclength around the loop,
across the band). Content that flows in `s` travels around the loop and **returns on the "other"
apparent side through the Möbius half-twist** — the geometric payoff, made drivable.

This is voxeled's importer stance in miniature: a procedural piece is mapped by *evaluating its
parametrization*; a scanned piece would instead come from the camera automapper (Phase 2) — but
both land in the same scene shape (`position + normal + address`).

## Patterns

- **`ribbonChase`** — a hue chase in ribbon-arclength `s`; watch it flow around and come back on
  the far side via the Möbius twist. Uses *fixture-local* `s`, so every instance stays in sync.
- **`worldWipe`** — a plane of light wiping along a world axis. Its `space` flag is the distance
  toggle (below): `world` accounts for the gap between instances, `fixture` syncs them.
- **`planeSweep`** — repeating planes rising at a real speed (mm/s). Purely world-space — proves
  the animation is *spatial*, reading correctly across the non-flat, twisting ribbon.
- **`normalRGB`** — paints each pixel's emission normal as colour (x,y,z → r,g,b). Always lit; the
  colour field you see *is* the emission-direction field — the direct visual proof the map is right.
- **`spotlight`** — lights only the pixels a virtual camera can **see** — occluded strands (hidden
  behind the piece) and back-facing pixels go dark — as the vantage orbits. The Thread "in and out of
  view" problem, computed instead of hand-managed. See [`visibility.md`](visibility.md).
- **`projector`** — projection-maps a scrolling texture *through* that camera onto the visible
  surface (occlusion respected) — a preview of a VJ jacking a framebuffer into the piece.

## Multiple instances & the "account for distance" toggle

The scene is a **rig**: one heart *fixture* (its local geometry) placed as N *instances*, each with
a world transform (translation in mm + Euler rotation). `VOX_HEARTS=2 VOX_SPACING_FT=10` puts two
hearts 3048 mm apart in one shared world space. Each pixel then carries its **world** position
(after the instance transform) plus its `instance id`, so a pattern can choose which space to think in:

| space | with 2 hearts 10 ft apart | use it for |
|---|---|---|
| **world** | one wave crosses heart A, the empty 10-ft gap (dark, taking real time), then heart B — the distance is physically accounted for | a pattern that spans the whole installation |
| **fixture** | both hearts show the identical wave in sync; the gap is ignored | cloning one look across identical props |

`worldWipe({ space })` is exactly this switch. The hub supplies `ctx.local(px)` — it re-bases a
world pixel back into its instance's frame via the inverse transform — so *any* world-space pattern
can be made per-instance by sampling `ctx.local(px)` instead of `px.p`.

## Layout files (YAML)

The rig is a declarative YAML file — fixtures, their instances, and the show. The default:

```yaml
name: two-hearts
units: mm

fixtures:
  heart:
    type: mobius-heart          # a registered fixture type (run.mjs → FIXTURES)
    params: { panelsPerSide: 8, pitchMM: 10, twist: mobius }

instances:                      # copies in shared world space (mm, degrees)
  - { fixture: heart, name: left,  pos: [-1524, 0, 0] }
  - { fixture: heart, name: right, pos: [ 1524, 0, 0] }

show:
  holdS: 4
  fadeS: 2.5
  scenes:
    - { name: chase,  pattern: ribbonChase }
    - { name: across, pattern: worldWipe, params: { space: world } }
    - { name: synced, pattern: worldWipe, params: { space: fixture } }
```

- **fixtures** — reusable geometry built by a registered `type` + `params`. Add a new fixture
  type by registering a `(params) => { pixels, meta }` function in `run.mjs`'s `FIXTURES` map.
- **instances** — placements: `pos` (mm) and optional `rotDeg` (Euler degrees).
  [`facing-hearts.yaml`](../examples/mobius-heart/layouts/facing-hearts.yaml) shows rotation.
- **show** — the scene list the mixer crossfades; each scene is a `pattern` + `params`.

Point `VOX_LAYOUT` at any file. Parsing is a small dependency-free YAML *subset* (`src/yaml.mjs`)
— block maps/sequences, inline `[…]`/`{…}` flow, comments, typed scalars — enough for layout
files; swap in `js-yaml` if you outgrow it.

## Crossfading scenes

A **scene** is a look — a name + a pattern with its params bound. The **show** (`src/mixer.mjs`)
runs two scenes as A/B decks and dissolves between them by a fader `x ∈ [0,1]` (linear RGB lerp).
In **auto** mode it cycles the scene list on a timeline (hold, then crossfade to the next); the
viewer's **crossfader** overrides into **manual** and drives the fader directly (over a tiny
`GET /control` endpoint on the same server). The default show is:

```
chase (per-heart)  →  wipe · across (world)  →  wipe · synced (fixture)
```

so the auto-crossfade itself dissolves between the distance-aware and the synced looks.

## Driving the real piece

The heart's panels are HUB75 (or a transparent SPI film). voxeled stays protocol-side:

- **Art-Net / DDP → a Pi running FPP → HUB75** (FPP maps a pixel overlay onto `rpi-rgb-led-matrix`),
  or **DDP → WLED / the film's control box** for the transparent variant.
- The **same frames** drive the browser preview and the fixtures, so what you author is what lights.

## Verified

Run `npm test` — **58 checks across five suites** (`test/`): the mapper's unit normals + twist
depth; Art-Net framing (header, opcode `0x5000`, universe paging) and DDP framing (version/PUSH
flags, offset, length); the WebSocket bus (RFC-6455 handshake + full-frame binary delivery);
multi-instance placement + `ctx.local()` re-basing; `worldWipe` world-vs-fixture; the mixer
crossfade (endpoints, midpoint, auto timeline); the `/control` endpoint; the YAML-subset parser +
`resolveLayout` (both real layout files + error handling); and — the piece that used to be
unverifiable — a **headless-Chrome render gate** that boots the viewer, asserts it built its
geometry (the `VOXELED_READY` console signal) with no errors, and confirms it loads **offline**
(no CDN). The gate skips cleanly if Chrome isn't installed. The browser render is covered now too.
